# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

This course has been adapted from the course “Explorations in Data Science” which was created through a collaborative effort between Stanford University, YouCubed, and Google. It will introduce students to the main ideas in data science through free tools such as Google Sheets, Python, Data Commons and Tableau. Students will learn to be data explorers in project-based units, through which they will develop their understanding of data analysis, sampling, correlation/causation, bias and uncertainty, probability, modeling with data, making and evaluating data-based arguments, the power of data in society, and more. At the end of the course students will have a portfolio of their data science work to showcase their newly developed abilities.


### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

As this course is a new course being offered within our district, I can expect a lot of bumps in the road wheile we work out the kinks. The first issue that has, and will continue to arise is the issue of student access to the required materials. Since we are a K-12 school district serving children, there are many protections in place to keep their data secure. All new technology requirest district-level approval and some will require parent permission in order for students to utilize it. We do, however, have a very forward-thinking, and student friendly district and that allows more flexibility and more resources being given to support studnets in endavors such as starting a new course.  Since our district is focused upon equity, all sutdents recieve a rented chromebook capable of all technology needed in this course and home wifi is paid for by the district if a student cannot afford it.

This class will be offered to junior and senior students, and has a prerequisite of successful completion of both Algebra 1 and Geometry. Students will earn both math credit and elective credit for this course. Although it is technically a computer science course based on the content, the state has not approved it to be listed as a Career Technical Education (CTE) course, which is why students will only be earning math credit and not computer science pathway credit. After completing this course students are encouraged to enter an Introduction to Statistics course (if still in high school) or a Data Analysis course if they will be entering college.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

This course has been adapted from the course “Explorations in Data Science” which was created through a collaborative effort between Stanford University, YouCubed, and Google. It will introduce students to the main ideas in data science through free tools such as Google Sheets, Python, Data Commons and Tableau. Students will learn to be data explorers in project-based units, through which they will develop their understanding of data analysis, sampling, correlation/causation, bias and uncertainty, probability, modeling with data, making and evaluating data-based arguments, the power of data in society, and more. At the end of the course students will have a portfolio of their data science work to showcase their newly developed abilities.


### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

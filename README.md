# Educational Technology Plan

This educational technology plan is meant to outline the thought process in creating and adapting this course over time. It is meant to show that all relevant parties' ideas and opinions have been considered, and that the course is accessible to all students, regardless of background or history.

## Context

### Course

This course has been adapted from the course “Explorations in Data Science” which was created through a collaborative effort between Stanford University, YouCubed, and Google. It will introduce students to the main ideas in data science through free tools such as Google Sheets, Python, Data Commons and Tableau. Students will learn to be data explorers in project-based units, through which they will develop their understanding of data analysis, sampling, correlation/causation, bias and uncertainty, probability, modeling with data, making and evaluating data-based arguments, the power of data in society, and more. At the end of the course students will have a portfolio of their data science work to showcase their newly developed abilities.


### Situation

As this course is a new course being offered within our district, I can expect a lot of bumps in the road wheile we work out the kinks. The first issue that has, and will continue to arise is the issue of student access to the required materials. Since we are a K-12 school district serving children, there are many protections in place to keep their data secure. All new technology requirest district-level approval and some will require parent permission in order for students to utilize it. We do, however, have a very forward-thinking, and student friendly district and that allows more flexibility and more resources being given to support studnets in endavors such as starting a new course.  Since our district is focused upon equity, all sutdents recieve a rented chromebook capable of all technology needed in this course and home wifi is paid for by the district if a student cannot afford it.

This class will be offered to junior and senior students, and has a prerequisite of successful completion of both Algebra 1 and Geometry. Students will earn both math credit and elective credit for this course. Although it is technically a computer science course based on the content, the state has not approved it to be listed as a Career Technical Education (CTE) course, which is why students will only be earning math credit and not computer science pathway credit. After completing this course students are encouraged to enter an Introduction to Statistics course (if still in high school) or a Data Analysis course if they will be entering college.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

Students will be using their chromebooks on a daily basis, both in class and at home to complete their assignments. While, from a computing-power standpoint it would be more efficient to have this class in a computer lab, student chromebooks allow a flexibility that a lab does not offer. In our school district, we have a 1-to-1 ratio of chromebooks to students. Every student is given one when they enter the district. So it was much more manageable to adjust our software choices to be chromebook accessible than it was to try to manage the entire course in a computer lab. This will allow students who do not have access to a high-powered pc at home to still be able to access the course content outside of the classroom setting.

The students will use their assigned resources in the following manner:
**EduBlocks:** In the first few units, we will have in-class activities and projects that will involve coding. Since some students are entering the class with zero experience in coding, we will be using EduBlocks to give them insight and access to the world of Python coding.
**CODAP:** We use CODAP in our assignments for drag-and-drop statistical analysis. Students will use this to create advanced charts while they have not reached their full knowledge of statistical modeling. As thier skills progress we will transition out of this into Colab where they will do the modeling on their own.
**Google Colab:** This is our main resource in the course. We will be using Colab to code in Python. After Unit 2, students will be expected to write code that outputs their desired charts, images, and summary statistics based on their choice of mathematical model. 
**Kaggle:** as a backup in case Colab is not available or limited
**Google Sheets:** our EDA, or Exploratory Data Analysis, will all be done in Google Sheets. It will give students quick and easy summaries of the data, which will allow them to identify areas within the data to explore further. We will also be doing all cleaning of the data within Google Sheets due to its ease of access and formula based approach.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

As touched on above, by using technology in the way we have outlined here, it gives all students access to all resources no matter what they come to the class with. A computer is issued to them, and all software is free and online. Due to the nature of the course, it is also not required for students to complete work outside of the classroom. At some points it may be helpful, but a student who gives the appropriate amount of effort during class time should have no trouble completing the tasks given. This course would also have a seamless transition to virtual/distance learning if necessary, since all resources are provided and students can theoretically work from anywhere. 

Another glaring positive about this course is its adaptability to current trends and student needs. Data from any topic is able to be analyzed. Students can follow their interests when it comes to projects in data science.  In addition, since it is a new field of study in high school, we all (students, teachers, counselors, administrators) need to be flexible in that, as new technologies and topics emerge, the class will need to evolve to fit those things. Based on the current course, we are in a great position to be adaptable when these situations occur. 

In addition, while not specifically edtech based, we do have a representative teacher for the school (me), who has created a recruitment video and who also goes to each of the classes of eligible students and presents on the data science course. The goal is to clear up any misconceptions about the course, show students what topics the course covers, and show students how the course is managed. The biggest selling point is explaining to students that the course is exploratory in nature and allows students to work together to dive deeper into topics of their own personal interest.
